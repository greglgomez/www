## Frontmatter Reference

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `title` | string | Content title |
| `created` | date | Creation date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `updated` | date | Last updated date |
| `growth` | enum | `seedling`, `budding`, or `evergreen` |
| `topics` | array | List of topic tags |
| `type` | string | Content type (must match collection) |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Available For | Description |
|-------|------|---------------|-------------|
| `featured` | boolean | All | Show on homepage |

| `category` | string | projects | Sub-category |

## Growth Stages Explained

### ðŸŒ± Seedling
- New ideas
- Rough thoughts
- May change significantly
- Under 500 words typically

### ðŸŒ¿ Budding
- Developing concepts
- Partially formed
- Being actively worked on
- 500-1500 words

### ðŸŒ³ Evergreen
- Mature content
- Well-researched
- Regularly maintained
- 1500+ words or complete projects

## Wikilinks

### Basic Syntax
```markdown
[[slug]]              # Links to content with that slug
[[slug|Custom Text]]  # Link with custom display text
```

### How It Works
1. System searches all collections for matching slug
2. Falls back to matching title (case-insensitive)
3. Converts spaces to dashes automatically

### Examples
```markdown
See my [[digital-gardens]] note.
Learn about [[digital-gardens|digital gardening]].
Check out the [[night-sight]] project.
```

### Best Practices
- Use descriptive slugs (filename without .md)
- Keep slugs lowercase with dashes
- Link early and often
- Update links when renaming files

## Topics System

### Creating Topics
Just add them to the `topics` array:

```yaml
topics: [development, typescript, web-development]
```

### Topic Naming
- Use lowercase
- Use dashes for multi-word topics
- Be consistent (choose one term and stick with it)
- Think about how you'll browse/filter later

### Common Topics
- Content type: `note`, `tutorial`, `guide`
- Domain: `development`, `product-management`, `design`
- Technology: `astro`, `typescript`, `3d-printing`
- Status: `work-in-progress`, `archived`

## Workflow Tips

### Starting a New Note
```bash
# Create file
touch src/content/notes/my-new-note.md

# Add frontmatter
# Start writing
# Link to related content with [[wikilinks]]
```

### Growing Content
1. Start as seedling (rough ideas)
2. Develop to budding (add detail, links)
3. Mature to evergreen (polish, maintain)

### Content Maintenance
- Update `updated` field when making changes
- Add more wikilinks as you create related content
- Upgrade growth stage as content matures
- Review and update evergreen content periodically

### Drafts
Hide unfinished content:
```yaml
draft: true
```

### Featured Content
Show on homepage:
```yaml
featured: true
```

## File Naming

### Good Names
- `digital-gardens.md`
- `night-sight-v2.md`
- `iceland-2025.md`
- `product-management-principles.md`

### Avoid
- `note1.md` (not descriptive)
- `My Cool Idea.md` (use dashes, not spaces)
- `temp.md` (not meaningful)

## Writing Tips

### Be Yourself
- Write naturally
- Don't worry about polish (especially for seedlings)
- Share the process, not just results

### Link Often
- Link to related notes
- Create notes for concepts you reference
- Build a web of ideas

### Keep It Growing
- Return to old notes
- Add new insights
- Update growth stages
- Create new links

### Use Markdown Features
```markdown
# Headings for structure

**Bold** for emphasis
*Italic* for quotes or titles

- Lists
- Are
- Great

> Blockquotes for important points

`code` for technical terms

\`\`\`
code blocks for longer snippets
\`\`\`
```

## Common Issues

### Link Not Working?
- Check slug matches filename (without .md)
- Try lowercase version
- Verify file exists in correct collection

### Images Not Showing?
- Ensure path starts with `/`
- Check file is in `public/images/`
- Verify filename is correct (case-sensitive)

### Build Errors?
- Check frontmatter syntax (proper YAML)
- Verify dates are YYYY-MM-DD format
- Ensure required fields are present
- Check for typos in growth/type/category enums

## Next Steps

1. Create your first note in `src/content/notes/`
2. Add some wikilinks to connect ideas
3. Document a project
4. Write an essay
5. Curate resource collections

Remember: Your digital garden grows over time. Start small, iterate, and enjoy the process!
