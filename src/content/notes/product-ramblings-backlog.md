This is just a long lists of things that I want to write about, in rough order of priority.
If I've started writing about it, it will be a link.

- I run a twice monthly lean coffee for my work place's Product Community of Practice and there's always a few recurring themes that eventually crop up again, I want to take these and write a whole raft of short reads on "So you want to create X but you have Y problem, here's what to do". Things like:
	- "You want to do discovery but there's no time"
	- "You need to prioritise but everyone says everything is urgent"
	- "You need to measure outcomes but only have output metrics"
- As part of some product maturity work, one area I'm working on is around product strategy. A pain point I've found here is around the organisation wanting Product Managers to be strategic, but there's a missing link between the organisational strategy and the product strategy. I think there's a few things to talk about here.
	- "How to influence upward when strategy is unclear"
	- "Strategic thinking skills for individual contributors"
	- "Bottom-up product strategy"
