Digital gardens are a new way of thinking about personal websites and knowledge management.

## Key Principles

1. **Imperfection** - Not everything needs to be polished
2. **Learning in public** - Share the process, not just the results
3. **Evergreen content** - Ideas that grow and evolve over time
4. **Networked thinking** - Ideas connect to each other
