This is my first note in this digital garden. I'm excited to start cultivating ideas here!

## What is a digital garden?

A [[digital-gardens|digital garden]] is a public space for thinking, learning, and growing ideas. Unlike a traditional blog with polished, chronological posts, a digital garden is:

- **Organic** - Content evolves over time
- **Interconnected** - Ideas link to each other
- **Non-linear** - No strict hierarchy or order
- **Growth-oriented** - Marked by stages (ðŸŒ± seedling, ðŸŒ¿ budding, ðŸŒ³ evergreen)

## How this works

I'll be posting:

- Notes on topics I'm exploring
- [[projects|Project portfolios]] from my work
- Development journals as I build things
- Photography from my travels
- Curated collections of links and resources

Everything is connected through wikilinks, making it easy to navigate between related ideas.
